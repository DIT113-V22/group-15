## **What are we going to make?**
    A shopping assistant which will drive around in a store. It will give the user directions and information about specific items in the store. The car
    will have some awareness of its surroundings and avoid driving into objects. It will also show the way to the item by going there.

## **Why will we make it?**
    To aid customers in finding their way around, as well as provide information about different items location in the store.  

## **What problem does it solve?**
    Overcome the problem of navigation in large stores. 

## **How are we going to make it?**
App/webpage: One interface for the customer - one interface for the shop owner/employees. Customers: are able to use voice commands to ask the car
(assistant) about items they are searching for and the car will tell the customer where the item is located; possibly show a path via an interface to the
desired item, based on the customer's current location, which the customer could follow in order to find the item. Shop owners/employees: are going to be
able to control the car manually or let the car drive autonomously in the store to relocate or to navigate to a certain location. The car (assistant):
would roam around in the store aimlessly and will have an obstacle avoidance feature so it doesn't get stuck.
## **What kind of technology we are going to use?**
    
    C++, HTML, CSS
    Web server 
    Voice recognition
    Arduino
    Map development
    GUI development 
    Car logic development
    Manhattan Path
